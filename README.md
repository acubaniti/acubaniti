ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @acubanit, designer based in Romania, originally from the coast of the Black Sea. Iâ€™ve started my career, as a graphic designer, at the age of 16, creating print materials for a
local print company, directly handling the customers' requests from initial discussion to hand-off of the physical print. Directly interacting with the client allowed me to greatly
appreciate design, seeing how it impacted people in different ways be it even emotionally by putting a smile on their face. Having an affinity for technology took me
to front-end development, Ui/Ux and digital design. Since then Iâ€™ve worked for multiple companies, from multinational corporations to design studios, developing my skills in
the process and gathering a better understanding of different design and web development processes.
